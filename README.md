# Age (Historgram)
A histogram is the best visualization for age because it shows the distribution of employees across different age groups, making it easy to identify patterns and trends. Since age is a continuous variable, a histogram effectively groups values, helping to reveal whether the data is normally distributed or skewed. 

# Gender (Pie Chart)
A pie chart is best for gender because it visually represents the proportion of males and females in the dataset. Since gender is a categorical variable with only two distinct groups, a pie chart makes it easy to compare the relative sizes of each category at a glance.

# Job Status (Bar Chart)
A bar chart is the best visualization for Job Status because it clearly shows the count of employees in each category (Employed, Unemployed, Retired, Terminated). Since Job Status is a categorical variable, a bar chart makes it easy to compare the number of employees across different statuses.

# Departments (Bar Chart)
A bar chart is best for Department because it effectively displays the number of employees in each department, making it easy to compare different groups. Since Department is a categorical variable, a bar chart clearly shows the distribution without unnecessary complexity, it is also easier to see differences in department sizes at a glance.

# Years at Company (Box Plot)
A box plot is the best visualization for the Years at Company column because it effectively summarizes the distribution of the data, efficiently showing key statistics like the median, quartiles, and outliers. 

# Location (Bar Chart)
A bar chart is best for the Location column because it effectively displays the number of employees at each location, making it easy to compare different groups. Since Location is a categorical variable, a bar chart clearly shows the distribution without unnecessary complexity, it is also easier to see differences in number of employees at each location at a glance.

# Education (Pie Chart)
A pie chart is one of the best visualizations for the education column because it represents the proportion of employees with an associates, bachelors, masters, and doctorates degree in the dataset. Since education is a categorical variable with 4 distinct groups, a pie chart makes it easy to compare the relative sizes of each category.

# Parking Pass (Pie Chart)
A pie chart is best for parking passes because it visually represents the proportion of employees with and without parking passes in the dataset. Since parking pass is a categorical variable with only two distinct groups, a pie chart makes it easy to compare the relative sizes of each category at a glance.

# PTO (Weeks) [Box Plot]
A box plot is the best visualization for the PTO (Weeks) column because it effectively summarizes the distribution of the data, efficiently showing key statistics like the median, quartiles, and outliers. 

# Days In-Office (Bar Chart)
A bar chart is best for the Days In-Office column because it effectively displays the number of days each week each of the employees comes to work in-person, making it easy to compare different groups.

# Commute Time (Hours) [Histogram]
A histogram is the best visualization for Commute Time (Hours) because it shows the distribution of commute times across employees, helping to identify common commute durations and potential outliers. Since commute time is a continuous numerical variable, a histogram effectively groups values, helping to reveal whether the data is normally distributed or skewed.
